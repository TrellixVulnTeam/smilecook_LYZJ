project for learning api development

This is a project I am creating in order to learn api development based on a book, "Python API Development Fundamentals" by PACKT

It is an API allowing for users to share recipes. They can search for recipes to find ones which they like, JWT tokens are used as authentication,
data is all stored in POSTGRESQL data bases, image compression is taken place, and data goes through serialization and deserialization using Marshmallow.
Finally, cool usefull features such as pagination, and auto emailing are added, and the entire api is built on top a front end server.
